          Over the years, archaeologists have uncovered many different kinds of
          clay figurines dogū dating to Japan’s prehistoric Jōmon period
          (14,000–300 bce)­. The most diverse forms have been excavated in
          northeastern Japan, where this figurine of a female was discovered.
          Some are seated, others standing, some have heart-shaped heads, others
          round and wearing headpieces, some have little or no surface
          decoration, and others, like this example, known as a shakōki or
          “goggle-eyed” type, have distinctive large eyes and are adorned with
          color and complex carved decorations. No one knows for sure how these
          figurines were used, but there are several theories. The prevailing
          theory holds that they served as talismans related to health and
          childbirth, and that after they were used they were purposefully
          broken and disposed of, which may account for the fact that dogū are
          found with missing limbs or other seemingly purposeful breaks.

          The Hindu god Shiva appears in several incarnations. Here, Shiva
          appears as Nataraja, or Lord of the Dance. He raises his left foot in
          a graceful dance pose. In his upper right hand, Nataraja holds a drum,
          the sound of which manifests creation. The flame that he holds in his
          upper left hand symbolizes destruction. Together, they symbolize the
          creation and destruction of the cosmic universe. The posture of the
          icon’s lower left and right palms signifies protection. The foot that
          rests on the demon’s back symbolizes the elimination of ignorance,
          while the raised left foot signifies salvation. A now missing ring of
          fire, symbolic of the simultaneous and continuous creation and
          destruction of the universe, would have encircled the bronze icon.

          The sculptural quality of these dashing beasts is conveyed by their
          stances, the proud carriage of their heads, and the apparent agility
          of their bodies. The forceful comma-shaped tails and their jaunty
          tufts, as well as the double-rope patterns on the moustaches, are
          typical elements of Warring States period art.

          The sculpture titled Shōki Capturing a Demon with a Hat is a
          19th-century ivory netsuke created by the Japanese artist Harumitsu.
          It depicts Shōki, a legendary figure in Chinese and Japanese
          mythology, known for his role as a vanquisher of evil spirits and
          demons. In the artwork, Shōki is portrayed in a dynamic pose,
          capturing a demon with a hat, which is a common motif in traditional
          Japanese art symbolizing protection from evil forces. Shōki was often
          depicted as a guardian spirit, believed to have the power to command
          demons and protect homes, especially in areas with valuable goods.
